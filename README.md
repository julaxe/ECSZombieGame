Zombie game for game engines 4

Final project for Game engines 4 where we needed to make an endless twin shooter zombie game.

I decided to experiment with Unity dots and create a game where I can have more than a thousand zombies and still have good amount of FPS.

At the end I could have more than 100.000 zombies and have an stable 40 fps.

I'm using Entity system, jobs system, Burst compiler and hybrid renderer.
